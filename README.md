# Go Codewars local setup

Small repro of the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) environment to work on katas locally.

Just use `make` or `make help` to know what commands are available.

For each kata, simply copy and paste your function in `kata.go` and the associated tests in `kata_test.go`, you can then run `make run` to start the test runner in watch mode.

Don't forget to set you `go.mod` version to the one you use in Codewars!

Happy coding :D
